The data may or may not have a BOM. The most efficient encoding to use for parsing is UTF-8, so if you have a choice in encoding the data passed to this method, use UTF-8.

	/// - Parameters:
	///   - resource: The name of the resource in the provided bundle.
	///   - fileExtension: The file extension of the resource.
	///   - bundle: The bundle to look in for the resource.
	///   - options: Options for reading the JSON data and creating the Foundation objects.
	///              For possible values, see JSONSerialization.ReadingOptions.
	/// - Returns: A Foundation object from the JSON data in data, or nil if an error occurs.
	/// - Throws: An error if the resource couldn't be found or if JSON serialisation failed.
